## About the Game

Particle Accelerator Incremental is a physics-themed idle game that simulates a particle collider. Start with a small accelerator and a single electron, then build your way up to a complex machine with multiple particle types and automated systems.

## How to Play

1. **Start by clicking** on the accelerator ring to boost particles and generate energy
2. **Purchase upgrades** in the right panel to improve your accelerator and particles
3. **Create collisions** between particles to generate energy
4. **Unlock new particles** like positrons, muons, and tauons

## Features

- Visual particle accelerator with realistic physics
- Multiple particle types with unique properties
- Magnet system to boost particle speeds
- Upgrade system with different categories:
  - Click upgrades
  - Accelerator structure
  - Particle improvements
  - Production enhancements
- Achievement system to track your progress
- Auto-save functionality

## Game Mechanics

- **Particles**: Different particles have unique properties - some move clockwise, others counter-clockwise, and some have greater stability
- **Collisions**: When particles collide, they produce energy based on their speed, size, and other factors
- **Magnets**: Strategic placement of magnets around the accelerator boosts particles as they pass by
- **Decay**: Particles have limited lifespans based on their stability, requiring careful management

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- CSS3 for styling
